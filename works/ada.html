    <h2>1. Research</h2>
    <div class="context">
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>Vermic Studios is an educational technology company with over 30 years of experience creating interactive
        learning
        software. Since 1990, it has developed popular applications in Mexico such as Dracula's Castle, Magic Keys, and
        School
        Tutor, blending education with entertainment.
        Through its platform Aprendo con Vermic, it has reached over 500 schools and 100,000 households, offering
        content
        aligned with preschool, elementary, and middle school levels, along with tools for teachers and institutions to
        create
        their own digital content.
        Vermic is currently developing ADA, a new educational platform for students from elementary to high school. ADA
        maintains Vermic’s core pedagogical values while offering a more intuitive, accessible, and
        school-level-specific
        experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="problem">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Vermic Studios, known for its educational content, faces the challenge of turning that experience into a modern,
        user-centered platform. The current site presents usability issues, weak segmentation, limited accessibility,
        and poor resource discoverability, which affect engagement and retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The editorial team also needs a more intuitive way to manage content without relying on technical support.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design challenge is to improve the platform’s structure, adapt navigation for each user type (teacher,
        student, institution), and streamline key tasks like searching, downloading, or purchasing educational
        materials. All of this must align with user needs and pedagogical goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results will be validated through user testing focused on task completion, perceived value, and ease of use.
      </p>
    </div>
     <div class="user-segmentation">
  <h3>User Segmentation</h3>
  <p>
    Vermic Studios has been used by various profiles over time, including students, teachers, school coordinators, and editorial teams. 
    Each one interacts with the system differently, so identifying them was essential before designing any solution.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> plan lessons, find and adapt resources, and track student progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Students:</strong> access and complete activities assigned by teachers.</li>
    <li><strong>Coordinators:</strong> select educational packages and supervise implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Editorial team:</strong> create and maintain content with a focus on pedagogical quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For this project, the UX/UI process focused specifically on <strong>teachers, students, and the editorial team</strong>. 
    These profiles were selected for their frequent interaction with the platform and their direct impact on the quality of the learning experience.

  <p>At this stage, I focused on identifying who the users were and how they interacted within the platform.</p>

  <div class="define-block">
    <h3>Actor Map</h3>
    <p>
      ADA isn’t just used by students and teachers. There are also people behind the scenes who make decisions, provide support, or influence the experience from the outside. 
      After reviewing the first version, I grouped the actors into four categories: core users, school management, support and providers, and external environment.
    </p>

    <img src="../assets/images/mapactores.png" alt="Actor Map - ADA" class="project-cover medium">

    <p>Here’s how I defined their level of involvement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core users:</strong> students and teachers who interact directly with the platform on a daily basis.</li>
      <li><strong>School management:</strong> academic coordinators and administrators who help implement and oversee how the platform is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Support and providers:</strong> the editorial and technical teams are very involved in creating and maintaining the content. External tech providers offer the tools that support the system.</li>
      <li><strong>External environment:</strong> parents and educational authorities don’t use the platform directly, but they still play a role in the overall experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This analysis helped me focus the design around three key roles: students, teachers, and the editorial team. 
      By understanding how they connect with each other, I was able to align design decisions with real user needs and responsibilities.

  <h3> User Personas</h3>

  <p>
    The goal of this section is to identify and represent the key profiles who interact with the Vermic Studios educational platform, understanding their behaviors, needs, and pain points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through user personas, we aim to design more aligned solutions, avoiding generic assumptions and focusing on those who actually experience the platform daily: teachers, students, and the editorial team.
  </p>

  <p>
    These representations help us make informed design decisions, prioritize features, improve navigation, and adapt the interface to different levels of understanding and context.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this research phase, we created <strong>three main user personas</strong> representing the most active and critical profiles within the Vermic Studios ecosystem:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Teachers</strong>, who plan and adapt the content for their groups</li>
    <li><strong>Students</strong>, who consume the content in various environments</li>
    <li><strong>Editorial team</strong>, who manage and update materials in the platform</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These user personas are important because they allow us to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deeply understand</strong> key actors’ needs, frustrations, and goals</li>
    <li><strong>Make informed design decisions</strong> based on real users</li>
    <li><strong>Adapt language, UI, and flows</strong> to different digital experiences</li>
    <li><strong>Visualize friction points</strong> and design tailored solutions for each profile</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We identified common patterns among them that are essential for guiding the redesign of the platform:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Teachers seek efficiency, clarity, and control over the resources used in class.</li>
    <li>Students need clear guidance, intuitive navigation, and a tone that fits their digital habits.</li>
    <li>The editorial team (not visually represented) often struggles with keeping the platform updated, organizing content by grade, and ensuring quality across profiles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>The most relevant needs found were:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interface personalization by user type</li>
    <li>Improved navigation and content structure</li>
    <li>Immediate clarity on what to see, what to use, and how</li>
    <li>Support for both printable and mobile-friendly formats</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This analysis not only humanizes the data but also enables more empathetic and realistic design decisions. The next steps in the project should focus on <strong>solutions tailored to each profile</strong>, minimizing friction and maximizing clarity across different educational contexts.
